## How to Use

Navigate to: `/slingplanering` (or click "Slingplanering" in menu)

### 3. Add Customers
**Method 1: Load Demo Data**
- Click "Ladda demo-kunder" button
- 5 test customers load automatically
- Map shows all locations

**Method 2: Add Manually**
1. Enter customer name (e.g., "Anna Andersson")
2. Start typing address (e.g., "Kungsgatan 1, Stockholm")
3. Wait 1 second - suggestions appear
4. Click a suggestion
5. Coordinates are added automatically
6. Click "Lägg till kund"
7. Customer appears on map!

### 4. Optimize Route
- Click "Optimera slinga" button
- Backend calculates best order (using Gurobi)
- Blue line connects customers in optimal order

## Differences from Google Maps

### ✅ What Still Works
- Interactive map ✅
- Custom markers ✅
- Route lines ✅
- Address search ✅
- Geocoding ✅
- Click popups ✅

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Address search has 1 second delay (was instant)
- Route lines are straight (not following roads)
- No satellite view
- No Street View
- No real-time traffic

### 💡 Workaround
Your Gurobi backend still calculates optimal routes using real distances!
The map just shows simplified visualization.

## Troubleshooting

### Map doesn't load?
- Check internet connection
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache

### Address search not working?
- Wait 1 full second after typing
- Make sure you're typing Swedish addresses
- Try a more specific address (include city)

### Markers not appearing?
- Check that addresses have coordinates
- Look in browser console for geocoding errors
- Make sure Nominatim service is up

## Technical Notes

### Rate Limits
- **Nominatim:** 1 request per second (we auto-debounce)
- **OSM Tiles:** Unlimited for normal use
- Both are generous and free!

### Attribution
- "© OpenStreetMap contributors" - Required, don't remove!
- Shows in map legend and autocomplete

### Libraries Installed
```json
{
  "leaflet": "Latest",
  "react-leaflet": "4.x",
  "@types/leaflet": "Latest"
}
```
