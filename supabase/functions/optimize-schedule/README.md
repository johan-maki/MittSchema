# Schedule Optimizer

This Edge Function implements a placeholder for the Google OR-Tools CP-SAT scheduler integration. 

## Current Implementation

The current implementation provides a scaffold for integrating with OR-Tools, but uses a simplified algorithm for demonstration purposes. It:

1. Takes employee profiles, schedule settings, and date range as input
2. Generates a basic schedule based on employee roles and availability
3. Returns the schedule with metadata about the optimization

## Integrating with Google OR-Tools

To fully implement OR-Tools optimization, you'll need to:

1. Create a separate Python service that uses OR-Tools CP-SAT solver
2. Deploy this service where it can be accessed by the Edge Function
3. Update this Edge Function to call the Python service API

### Option 1: External Python Service

```
# Example Python model using OR-Tools (to be implemented in separate service)
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def create_schedule_model(employees, settings, start_date, end_date):
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    
    # Define variables
    # For each employee, day, and shift type, create a binary variable
    # that is 1 if the employee works that shift on that day, 0 otherwise
    
    # Add constraints:
    # 1. Minimum staffing requirements
    # 2. Maximum consecutive days
    # 3. Minimum rest hours between shifts
    # 4. Employee availability and preferences
    
    # Define objective function to maximize
    # - Employee preference satisfaction
    # - Fair distribution of shifts
    # - Experience level requirements
    
    # Return model
    return model

def solve_model(model):
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    status = solver.Solve(model)
    
    if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
        # Extract solution
        return solution
    else:
        return None
```

### Option 2: WebAssembly Integration

Alternatively, it may be possible to compile a simplified version of OR-Tools to WebAssembly and run it directly in the Edge Function.

## Next Steps

1. Implement a Python service with OR-Tools CP-SAT solver
2. Deploy the service with an API endpoint
3. Update this Edge Function to call the external API
4. Add authentication between the Edge Function and the Python service
