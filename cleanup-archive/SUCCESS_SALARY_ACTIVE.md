# ✅ SUCCESS! Salary Implementation is Now Active

## 🎉 Database Migration Completed Successfully!

Your SQL migration worked perfectly! All 6 employees now have 1000 SEK/hour as their default salary.

## 🔍 What You Can Test Now

### 1. **Employee Salary Management**
- Navigate to **Directory** (Personal section)
- Click **Edit** on any employee
- You'll see a new **"Timlön (SEK)"** field
- Default value: 1000 SEK
- You can change it and save

### 2. **Schedule Cost Display**
- Go to **Schedule** view
- Look for the cost information in:
  - **Desktop**: Quick stats bar shows total cost (e.g., "15,750 SEK")
  - **Mobile**: Cost card in statistics grid with orange dollar icon
  - **Real-time updates** when you navigate between weeks

### 3. **Directory Table**
- In the Directory, you'll see a new **"Timlön"** column
- Shows each employee's hourly rate
- Hidden on small screens for better mobile experience

## 🧪 Quick Test Checklist

Open http://localhost:3000 and verify:

- [ ] Directory table shows hourly rates (1000 SEK for all employees)
- [ ] Can edit employee → salary field is present and functional
- [ ] Schedule view shows total cost in statistics
- [ ] Cost updates when viewing different weeks/months
- [ ] Mobile view shows cost card in statistics

## 💰 Expected Results

**Current Schedule Costs** (based on your data):
- Each shift = 8 hours × 1000 SEK = 8,000 SEK per shift
- Your schedules should show realistic total costs
- Example: 15 shifts per week = 120,000 SEK

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test different salary amounts**: Edit an employee's salary and see how it affects schedule costs
2. **Generate new schedules**: The Gurobi optimizer now includes cost calculation
3. **Monitor budget**: Use the cost display to track scheduling expenses
