# 🎉 Salary & Cost Implementation - READY TO USE

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

I have successfully implemented a complete salary and cost management system for your healthcare scheduling application. Here's what's been added:

### 🏥 Employee Salary Management
- **Full UI for setting employee salaries** (default: 1000 SEK/hour)
- **Salary editing in the Directory/Personal view** for managers
- **Validation and professional form handling**
- **Responsive table display** with salary column

### 💰 Real-Time Cost Calculation & Display
- **Automatic cost calculation** based on shift hours × employee hourly rate
- **Cost display in schedule statistics** (both desktop and mobile)
- **Swedish number formatting** (e.g., "15,750 SEK")
- **Professional UI integration** with existing schedule views

### 🔧 Technical Integration
- **Backend cost calculation** in Gurobi optimizer
- **Database query updates** to include salary data
- **Type-safe implementation** with full TypeScript support
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEP

**You MUST run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard before the salary features will work:**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run this SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN hourly_rate DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 1000.00;
UPDATE employees SET hourly_rate = 1000.00;
```

3. Verify with: `SELECT first_name, last_name, hourly_rate FROM employees;`

## 🧪 Testing After Migration

```bash
# 1. Verify the migration worked
node test-salary-implementation.mjs

# 2. Ensure all employees have 1000 SEK (optional)
node update-all-employee-salaries.mjs

# 3. Start the app and test
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 What You'll See

### In the Directory (Personal Management):
- ✅ New "Timlön" column showing each employee's hourly rate
- ✅ Edit employee → Set salary field with validation
- ✅ Default 1000 SEK for all employees

### In Schedule Views:
- ✅ **Desktop**: Quick stats bar shows total cost (e.g., "15,750 SEK")
- ✅ **Mobile**: Cost card in statistics grid
- ✅ **Real-time updates** when viewing different weeks/months
- ✅ **Accurate calculation** based on actual shift hours and employee rates

### Examples:
```
Week Statistics:
- 120h total hours
- 15 shifts
- 95% coverage  
- 15,750 SEK total cost ← NEW!

Cost Breakdown:
- Day shift (8h): Anna (1000 SEK/h) = 8,000 SEK
- Evening shift (8h): Erik (1000 SEK/h) = 8,000 SEK  
- Night shift (12h): Maria (1200 SEK/h) = 14,400 SEK
```

## 📱 User Experience

### For Managers:
1. **Set Employee Salaries**: Directory → Edit Employee → Set hourly rate
2. **View Schedule Costs**: All schedule views show total cost automatically
3. **Monitor Budget**: Real-time cost updates as you modify schedules

### For Schedule Generation:
- **Gurobi optimizer** now includes salary data in optimization
- **Cost information** returned with every schedule generation
- **Backend integration** with all existing features

## 🔥 Key Features

- ✅ **Complete salary management system**
- ✅ **Real-time cost calculation and display**
- ✅ **Professional UI with Swedish localization**
- ✅ **Mobile-responsive design**
- ✅ **Type-safe implementation**
- ✅ **Integration with existing Gurobi optimization**

## 🎊 Ready to Use!
