# Implementation Complete: Salary Support & Schedule Optimization

## ðŸŽ‰ ALL TASKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### âœ… Salary Support Implementation
- **Database**: Added `hourly_rate` column to employees table (default: 1000 SEK)
- **Backend**: Integrated salary into Gurobi optimizer cost calculation
- **Frontend**: Added salary editing in employee management UI with validation
- **UI**: Added salary column to directory table with Swedish formatting

### âœ… Cost Calculation & Display
- **Backend**: Returns detailed cost data per shift in API response
- **Frontend**: Professional cost display in schedule summary and monthly view
- **Formatting**: Swedish number formatting (1 000 SEK) with orange dollar icon
- **Mobile**: Responsive cost display for mobile devices
- **API Fix**: Added total_cost field to ScheduleResponse model for proper JSON serialization

### âœ… Total Cost API Integration (Latest Fix)
- **Issue**: Backend calculated total_cost but field was missing from API response
- **Root Cause**: Pydantic ScheduleResponse model didn't include total_cost field
- **Solution**: Added `total_cost: Optional[float] = None` to ScheduleResponse model
- **Verification**: API now properly returns total_cost in JSON response
- **Status**: âœ… Complete - committed and pushed (commit c5799b3)

### âœ… Schedule Optimization Fixes
- **Perfect Weekend Fairness**: Increased Gurobi weight â†’ all employees get exactly same weekend shifts (range=0)
- **Missing Shifts Fixed**: Resolved first night and last day bugs by ensuring all days are scheduled
- **Verified Coverage**: All 31 days of July have complete shift coverage

### âœ… Backend Cleanup
- **Single Optimizer**: Removed all legacy/local scheduling code - only Gurobi is used
- **API Health**: Fixed endpoint issues, verified `/optimize-schedule` works correctly
- **Process Management**: Proper backend restart and Python cache clearing

### âœ… Testing & Verification
- **Debug Scripts**: Created comprehensive test scripts for salary, cost, and fairness
- **API Testing**: Verified all endpoints work correctly with curl commands
- **End-to-End**: Tested complete workflow from schedule generation to cost display

## ðŸ“Š Current System State

### Schedule Quality
- **Coverage**: 100% (all 31 days covered)
- **Weekend Fairness**: Perfect (range=0 - all employees equal)
- **Cost Calculation**: Accurate and displayed prominently
- **Shift Distribution**: Optimized by Gurobi for fairness and constraints

### Technical Health
- **Backend**: Gurobi service running and responding correctly
- **Frontend**: All UI components updated and responsive
- **Database**: Salary data populated for all employees
- **API**: All endpoints functioning with proper cost data
