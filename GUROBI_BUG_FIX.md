# üêõ GUROBI CONSTRAINT BUG - EXACT FIX FOUND!

## Problem Location
**File:** `scheduler-api/services/gurobi_optimizer_service.py`  
**Line:** Around 370-386 in `_add_employee_preference_constraints` method

## üîç The Bug
The code logs that it will HARD BLOCK employees but **never actually adds the constraint**:

```python
if weekday not in available_weekdays:
    if available_days_strict:
        # HARD CONSTRAINT: Employee absolutely cannot work this day
        logger.info(f"Employee {emp_id} HARD BLOCKED from {day_name} {date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} (weekday={weekday})")
        # ‚ùå MISSING CODE HERE - NO CONSTRAINT IS ADDED!
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix
Add these lines immediately after the logger statement:

```python
if weekday not in available_weekdays:
    if available_days_strict:
        # HARD CONSTRAINT: Employee absolutely cannot work this day
        logger.info(f"Employee {emp_id} HARD BLOCKED from {day_name} {date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} (weekday={weekday})")
        
        # ADD THESE LINES:
        for shift in self.shift_types:
            self.model.addConstr(
                self.shifts[(emp_id, d, shift)] == 0,
                name=f"hard_unavailable_day_{emp_id}_{d}_{shift}"
            )
        blocked_days += 1
```

## üéØ Expected Result
After this fix:
- Erik will get **0 weekend shifts** when `available_days_strict=true`
- The constraint will be mathematically enforced by Gurobi
- Erik's preferences will be fully respected

## üìã Instructions for Backend Developer
1. Open `scheduler-api/services/gurobi_optimizer_service.py`
2. Find the `_add_employee_preference_constraints` method (around line 370)
3. Look for the "HARD BLOCKED" logger statement
4. Add the missing constraint code shown above
5. Deploy to Render
6. Test with Erik's preferences

## üß™ Test Verification
Run this test after the fix:
```javascript
// Erik with strict weekday-only constraints should get 0 weekend shifts
{
  employee_id: "225e078a-bdb9-4d3e-9274-6c3b5432b4be",
  available_days: ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
  available_days_strict: true
}
```

Expected: **Erik gets 0 shifts on Saturday/Sunday** ‚úÖ
